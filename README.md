Projectile-Motion
=================


In this project and analysis we are to model the motion of a projectile fired at a specific target.
There is a set initial velocity (speed) of the projectile and we are to adjust the firing angle as quickly
as possible so as to hit the target. Several factors that affect a projectile path are considered; air
resistance being of the most imporatance. Since there is air resistance, we cannot use the anaylitic
depiction of the projectile path rather numerical integration is utilized.
